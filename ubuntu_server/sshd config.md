```bash
service ssh start
```

You can view and edit the `sshd_config` file using a text editor like `nano` or `vim`. For example:

bash

Copy code

`nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config`

Inspect the settings in the `sshd_config` file and make any necessary changes based on your requirements. After making changes, restart the SSH service to apply them.

If you're unsure about any specific settings or need further assistance, feel free to share the contents of your `sshd_config` file, and I can provide more targeted guidance!

So I should uncomment the line where it says Port 22?? 

Yes, if you want SSH to listen on the default port 22, you should uncomment the line that says `Port 22` in the `sshd_config` file.

Here's how you can do it:

plaintext

Copy code

`Port 22`

Remove the leading `#` character to uncomment the line.

After uncommenting the line, save the file and restart the SSH service for the changes to take effect:

bash

Copy code

`service ssh restart`

This will ensure that the SSH server listens on port 22 for incoming connections. If you want to use a different port, you can modify the `Port` directive accordingly and ensure that the corresponding port is open and accessible from external devices.

If you have any other specific requirements or questions, feel free to ask!

To remove the Docker images named `security_test` and `security_test2` along with their containers, you will need to follow these steps:

1. **Stop Running Containers (if any):** Before you can remove a Docker image, ensure that no containers are running using that image. It looks like your `security_test` and `security_test2` containers might not be running, but let's make sure by stopping any that are. Since you didn't specify containers by those names, I'll assume they correspond to the images `3ac61d4e87f1` and `af3b0fd83a34`.
    
    If there were any running containers using those images, you would stop them using:
   
```bash
docker stop a67319a31f24 c0b21c48a51b
```
    
2. **Remove the Containers:** Once the containers are stopped, you can remove them. This step is necessary because Docker does not allow you to remove an image if a container is still associated with it, even if the container is not running.
    
```bash
docker rm a67319a31f24 c0b21c48a51b
```
    
3. **Remove the Images:** After removing the containers, you can remove the Docker images. The `docker rmi` command is used for this purpose. You can specify the images by their image ID or tag. Since `security_test` and `security_test2` share the same image ID for one of the tags and have their unique IDs, you'll need to remove them by their specific image IDs or repository tags.
    
```bash
docker rmi 3ac61d4e87f1 af3b0fd83a34
```
    
    Or using the repository tags:
    
    bashCopy code
    
    `docker rmi security_test security_test2`
    

Please note, if any other containers (not listed in your `docker ps -a` output) are using the same images, Docker will not allow you to remove the images until those containers are also removed. If you encounter an error related to this, make sure all containers using the images are deleted first.

This process cleans up the specific Docker images and their containers from your system, freeing up space and removing them from your Docker environment.

- I got an error because I built containers from the same images
- I had to use the force option to untag the other images


```bash
ubuntu@upi:~/Docker/Docker$ docker rmi af3b0fd83a34
Error response from daemon: conflict: unable to delete af3b0fd83a34 (must be forced) - image is referenced in multiple repositories
ubuntu@upi:~/Docker/Docker$ docker rmi -f af3b0fd83a34

#ChatGPT 

It seems like your user account doesn't have the necessary permissions to access the Docker daemon. You can resolve this by adding your user to the `docker` group, which typically has the required permissions to interact with Docker.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Log in as a user with sudo privileges. If you're not logged in as root, ensure that your user account has sudo privileges.
    
2. Run the following command to add your user to the `docker` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker your_username
```

- Replace `your_username` with your actual username.

# Issue

It seems like the `docker` group doesn't exist on your system, which is unusual since Docker usually creates this group during installation. This could be due to various reasons, such as an incomplete Docker installation or a misconfiguration.

Here's how you can proceed to resolve this:

1. **Check Docker Installation**: First, verify that Docker is installed correctly on your system. You can do this by running:

```bash
sudo docker --version
```
- If Docker is installed, it should display the version information. If not, you may need to reinstall Docker.

2. **Ensure Docker Daemon is Running**: Make sure the Docker daemon is running. You can check its status by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```
- If it's not running, you can start it with:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```


3. **Reinstall Docker**: If Docker is not installed correctly or if the `docker` group is missing, consider reinstalling Docker following the official installation instructions for Ubuntu.


### Issue # 2

#ChatGPT 

It seems like there are some inconsistencies in your Docker installation. The fact that Docker commands are functional but the Docker service (`docker.service`) is not found indicates that Docker might not be installed as a service on your system, or it might be installed in a non-standard way.

Given this situation, here's a way to ensure Docker is running and to fix the permissions issue without relying on the Docker service:

1. **Check Docker Daemon**: Despite not having a systemd service, Docker might still be running as a process. You can check if the Docker daemon is running by running:

```bash
sudo docker info
```
- This command will provide information about the Docker daemon if it's running.

2. **Manually Manage Docker Daemon**: If Docker is running, you typically don't need to manually start or stop the Docker daemon. However, if you ever need to start it manually, you can use the `dockerd` command:

```bash
sudo dockerd
```

Please note that this command will start the Docker daemon in the foreground, and you might need to open a new terminal session to execute other commands.

To stop the Docker daemon, you can either use the `kill` command to terminate the process or press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where `dockerd` is running.

**Manage Docker Permissions**: To grant permissions directly to your user to access the Docker socket, you can change the ownership of the Docker socket file as follows:

```bash
sudo chown ubuntoo /var/run/docker.sock
```

Replace `ubuntoo` with your actual username.

After performing these steps, you should be able to run Docker commands without encountering permission denied errors. However, keep in mind that managing Docker without systemd might be less convenient and might not provide all the features and benefits of managing it as a service. If you prefer to have Docker installed as a service, you may need to reinstall Docker following the official instructions for Ubuntu.




   
4. **Create Docker Group Manually**: If Docker is installed but the `docker` group is missing, you can create it manually. Run the following command to create the group:

```bash
sudo groupadd docker
```

5. **Add User to Docker Group**: Once the `docker` group is created, you can add your user to it using the `usermod` command you tried earlier:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker ubuntoo
```

   
6. **Log out and Log Back In**: After adding your user to the `docker` group, make sure to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.

### Continued from before the Issue above

    
3. After adding your user to the `docker` group, you'll need to log out and log back in for the changes to take effect.
    
4. Once you've logged back in, try running the Docker command again:

```bash
docker version
```

You should now be able to run Docker commands without encountering permission denied errors. If you're still having issues, make sure Docker is installed correctly and that the Docker daemon is running.

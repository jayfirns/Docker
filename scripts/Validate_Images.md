Here is the [[Validate_Images_Result]]

This Bash script retrieves a list of all Docker images along with their digests, iterates through each image digest, and validates the image metadata. Here's a summary of its functionality:

1. **Get Image Digests**: The script uses the `docker images` command with the `--digests` flag to retrieve a list of Docker images along with their digests. It stores this information in the `image_digests` variable.
    
2. **Iterate Through Images**: It then iterates through each image digest using a `while` loop.
    
3. **Extract Image Information**: For each image digest, it extracts the image name and digest value using `awk`.
    
4. **Inspect Image Metadata**: It inspects the image metadata using `docker inspect` and captures both standard output and standard error.
    
5. **Validation**: Depending on whether the image information is obtained successfully (`exit_code`), it either confirms the image's validity or handles errors.
    
6. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during image inspection, it provides an error message and suggests resolutions based on common error scenarios using a `case` statement.
    
7. **Display Detailed Information**: Optionally, it can display detailed information about the image by uncommenting a specific line.

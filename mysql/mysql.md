lets set up another docker...

#ChatGPT 

Yes, that would be one approach to set up the database for your [[Wordpress]] site. You can run a MySQL or MariaDB container alongside your WordPress container to provide the database backend.

Here's how you can set it up using Docker:

1. **Pull MySQL or MariaDB Image**: First, pull the MySQL or MariaDB Docker image from Docker Hub. You can choose between MySQL and MariaDB based on your preference. For example, to pull the official MySQL image:

```bash
docker pull mysql
```
   
2. **Run MySQL Container**: Once the image is downloaded, you can run a MySQL container. Specify environment variables for the root password and database name. For example:

```bash
docker run --name wordpress-db -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw -e MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpress_db -d mysql
```

This command does the following
- starts a MySQL container named
	- wordpress-db
- Sets the root password to
	- my-secret-pw
- Creates a database named
	- wordpress_db

3. **Connect WordPress Container to MySQL**: Now that you have a MySQL container running, you can start your WordPress container and connect it to the MySQL container. Make sure to specify the `--network` option to connect both containers to the same network so they can communicate with each other.

```bash
docker run --name Johns_Home_Lab --network johns-network -d arm64v8/wordpress
```

4. **Complete WordPress Setup**: Follow the steps outlined earlier to set up WordPress, providing the database details (database name, username, password, and host) that you configured in the MySQL container.
  
By setting up a MySQL or MariaDB container alongside your WordPress container, you create a self-contained environment for your WordPress site, making it easy to manage and deploy.

If you prefer a more automated approach, you can also use Docker [[Compose file]] to define and manage both containers in a single configuration file.
